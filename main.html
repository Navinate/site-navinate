                    My name is Thomas (Trey) Cluff. I am a sophomore at the University of Washington. I intend to study
                    in
                    Human Centered Design and Engineering. I hope to focus on early childhood human computer
                    interaction to
                    improve how children and technology interact.

                <p id="p1">
                    Outside of my studies, I am a member of a highly competitive <a href="https://www.aruw.org/">robotics
                        team</a> at
                    UW that competes in DJI's ROBOMASTER competition. Before college I was a varsity member of my
                    highschool crew team. I also was the co-captain of my local FRC robotics team in Virginia before
                    moving
                    to Seattle for college. Other hobbies include origami, some light arduino tinkering, and playing
                    video
                    games.

                <p id="p1">
                    I'm AMAZING at CSS as you can tell from this great website. I am good at writing PHP code to
                    interact with databases. I have the most experience using mySQL for that. I also cna write
                    Javascript, HTML, JAVA, and the basics of Python (I'm learning more everyday though). I am also in
                    the process of teaching myself node.js and react.js as well as becoming familiar with Bootstrap.
                    Outside of web development, I am also semi proficient in Photoshop and I am currently teaching
                    myself Maya.
